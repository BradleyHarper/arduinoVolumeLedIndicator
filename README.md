Just a basic volume indicator.  

The louder you scream the more led's illuminate! :D

Little bit about the idea of this project...    

    I thought it would be a great idea to make this and bring it to a kids birthday party. The kids did a lot of screaming trying to get all the LED's to illuminate, parents were not too pleased. :p

In the interest of time I didn't refactor the code so it wasn't repetitive. I just wanted something that would work, I managed to cobble a more primitive version of this program before the party and I semi-refactored it afterwords.
